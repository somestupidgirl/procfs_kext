# ProcFS
A kernel-extension implementation of the `/proc` file system for macOS, exposing
running processes and threads as a filesystem with BSD- and Linux-compatible
per-process information. It began as a port of Kim Topley's proof-of-concept XNU
patch (see [Credits](#credits)) but has since diverged substantially.

Certain features and improvements are still planned and/or in development, but directory listing and the core per-process files work.

Tested on:

    - macOS 26 (Tahoe), Darwin 25.5.0, Apple Silicon (arm64e) — primary target
    - Builds as a universal binary (arm64e + x86_64)

> **Note on Apple Silicon:** under Pointer Authentication (PAC) the kernel's
> private symbols cannot be linked from a kext, and the in-memory symbol table is
> jettisoned after boot. Affected features are recovered either by forward-porting
> (e.g. `fd/`, `threads/`, `cmdline`) or by resolving the needed private symbols
> from the on-disk kernel collection via libklookup (e.g. `tty`). Anything still
> out of reach degrades gracefully (returns `ENOTSUP`/empty) rather than failing
> the mount. See [Feature status](#feature-status) below.

## What is procfs?
*procfs* lets you view the processes running on a UNIX system as nodes in the file system, where each process is represented by a single directory named from its process id. Typically, the file system is mounted at `/proc`, so the directory for process 1 would be called `/proc/1`. Beneath a process’ directory are further directories and files that give more information about the process, such as its process id, its active threads, the files that it has open, and so on. *procfs* first appeared in an early version of AT&T’s UNIX and was later implemented in various forms in System V, BSD, Solaris and Linux. You can find a history of the implementation of *procfs* at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs.

In addition to letting you visualize running processes, *procfs* also allows some measure of control over them, at least to suitably privileged users. By writing specific data structures to certain files, you could do such things as set breakpoints and read and write process memory and registers. In fact, on some systems, this was how debugging facilities were provided. However, more modern operating systems do this differently, so some UNIX variants no longer include an implementation of *procfs*. In particular, macOS doesn’t provide *procfs* so, although it’s not strictly needed, I thought that implementing it would be an interesting side project. The code in this repository provides an implementation of *procfs* for macOS. You can use it to see what processes and threads are running on the system and what files they have open. Later, I plan to add more features, beginning with the ability to inspect a thread’s address space to see which executable it is running and what shared libraries it has loaded.

### Root directory

At the root of the file system, alongside the per-process directories, are a few
Linux-compatible files and helpers:

| Entry        | Summary                                                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`cpuinfo`     | Linux-style CPU information (text)                                   |
|`loadavg`     | Linux-style load averages (text; true values via the `procfsd` daemon, CPU-utilisation approximation as fallback — see below) |
|`meminfo`     | Linux-style memory summary (text; `MemFree` is the FreeBSD non-wired estimate on Apple Silicon — see below) |
|`partitions`  | Linux-style partition table (text; all block devices via IOKit — see below) |
|`mtab`        | Linux-style mounted-filesystem table (`/etc/mtab` format: `device mountpoint fstype options 0 0`) |
|`stat`        | Linux-style kernel/system statistics (`cpu`/`cpuN` ticks, `btime`, `processes`; see below) |
|`vmstat`      | Linux-style virtual-memory statistics (daemon-backed `host_statistics64`; see below) |
|`version`     | Kernel version string (text)                                        |
|`curproc`     | Symbolic link to the calling process's directory                    |
|`byname/`     | Directory of symbolic links, one per process, named by command name |

### Per-process files

Each directory named for a process id represents one process on the system. By default you can only see your own processes, although it is possible to set an option (`noprocperms`) when mounting the file system that will let you see and get details for every process. Obviously this is a security risk, so it’s not the default mode of operation. Within each process directory are the following files and two further directories. Most files contain binary structures rather than text, so they are intended to be used in applications rather than for direct human consumption. You’ll find definitions of the structures in this table in the file */usr/include/sys/proc_info.h*.

| File    | Summary                          | Structure                       |
|---------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|`pid`      | Process id                       | `pid_t` (binary `int32`)         |
|`ppid`     | Parent process id                | `pid_t` (binary `int32`)         |
|`pgid`     | Process group id                 | `pid_t` (binary `int32`)         |
|`sid`      | Session id                       | `pid_t` (binary `int32`)         |
|`status`   | Basic process info               | `struct proc_bsdshortinfo`        |
|`taskinfo` | Info for the process’s Mach task | `struct proc_taskinfo` — exact via the `procfsd` daemon; falls back to the kext’s partial fill without it (see Feature status) |
|`cmdline`  | Process argument vector (NUL-separated, Linux format) | text |
|`tty`      | Controlling terminal device path (e.g. `/dev/ttys001`) | text |
|`note`     | Write a note to the process (NetBSD-style) | write-only; read returns `EINVAL`. **Delivery not yet implemented** |
|`limit`    | Process resource limits, one `<name> <cur> <max>` line per limit (`-1` = unlimited) | text |
|`regs`     | Representative thread's general registers, native Mach `arm_thread_state64_t` (x86_64: `x86_thread_state64_t`) — served by the `procfsd` daemon | binary |
|`fpregs`   | Representative thread's FP/SIMD registers, native `arm_neon_state64_t` (x86_64: `x86_float_state64_t`) — served by the daemon | binary |
|`auxv`     | XNU's auxiliary-vector equivalent — dyld's `apple[]` array (`key=value` strings) | text (NUL-separated) |

The `fd` directory contains one entry for each file that the process has open. Each entry is a directory that’s numbered for the corresponding file descriptor. Within each subdirectory you’ll find two files called `details` and `socket`. The `details` file contains a `vnode_fdinfowithpath` structure, which contains information about the file including its path name if it is a file system file. If the file is a socket endpoint, you can read a `socket_fdinfo` structure from the `socket` file.

The `threads` directory contains a subdirectory for each of the process’ threads, named by thread id. Each thread directory contains a single file called `info` that holds a `proc_threadinfo` structure. Thread *enumeration* works on Apple Silicon (the directory lists the real thread ids), and the per-thread `info` *contents* are now supplied exactly by the `procfsd` daemon (`proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDTHREADID64INFO)`); they read zero only when no daemon is connected (the private `fill_taskthreadinfo` is stripped from the arm64 kernel).

## Feature status

Verified with `test/test_features.sh`.

**Working (real data):**

  - Directory listing of the root and per-process directories via `ls`, `find`, `readdir(3)` and `getdirentries64(2)`
  - `version` — kernel version string
  - `cpuinfo` — Linux-style CPU information (some flag fields incomplete; see Issues)
  - `loadavg` — process count plus the true 1/5/15-minute load averages from the
    `procfsd` daemon (`getloadavg`); falls back to a CPU-utilisation approximation
    when no daemon is connected (see Apple Silicon note)
  - `meminfo` — Linux-style memory summary; `MemTotal` and `MemFree` are
    populated (`MemFree` via the FreeBSD non-wired estimate — see Apple Silicon note)
  - `partitions` — Linux-style table of block devices via IOKit (`IOMedia`):
    every whole disk and partition, mounted or not, with real major/minor, 1 K
    block counts and BSD names (falls back to the mounted-only list without
    IOKit — see note below)
  - `mtab` — Linux `/etc/mtab`-style table of every mounted filesystem
    (`device mountpoint fstype options 0 0`), via `vfs_iterate` + `vfs_statfs`
  - `stat` — Linux `/proc/stat`: per-CPU `cpu`/`cpuN` user/nice/system/idle
    ticks (from `processor_info`, the loadavg per-CPU source), `btime`
    (`kern.boottime`) and `processes`; interrupt/ctxt/fork counters read 0
  - `vmstat` — Linux `/proc/vmstat`: VM page counters from the `procfsd` daemon's
    `host_statistics64(HOST_VM_INFO64)`, mapped onto Linux keys (`nr_free_pages`,
    `pgpgin`/`pgpgout`, `pgfault`, …); zero without the daemon
  - `curproc` symlink and the `byname/` directory of per-process symlinks
  - Per-process `pid`, `ppid`, `pgid`, `sid` (binary `int32`)
  - Per-process `status` — `proc_bsdshortinfo` (pid/ppid/pgid, status, command
    name, real/effective/saved uids and gids, process flags)
  - `cmdline` — the process's argument vector, NUL-separated (the Linux
    `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` format); zombies and system processes report `(comm)`
  - `fd/` — enumerates the process's open file descriptors; per-fd `details`
    (`vnode_fdinfowithpath`) and `socket` (`socket_fdinfo`, common fields plus
    UNIX/IPv4 addresses)
  - `threads/` — enumerates the process's threads (one directory per thread id)
  - `task/` — the Linux name for the same per-thread view (`/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>`),
    one directory per thread id, with Linux-format per-thread files: `comm`,
    `stat`, `status`, `sched`, `maps` (and the binary `info`). Per-thread data
    (name, run state, user/system CPU time, priority, policy) comes from the
    `procfsd` daemon via `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDTHREADID64INFO)`; fields with no
    macOS source (Linux fault counters, CFS scheduler internals, register
    addresses, ctxt-switch counts) are reported as 0
  - `tty` — the process's controlling terminal device path (e.g. `/dev/ttys001`),
    empty when it has none
  - `limit` — the process's resource limits (FreeBSD `procfs_rlimit` format: one
    `<name> <cur> <max>` line per limit, `-1` for unlimited)
  - `mem` — the process's memory; the read offset is the virtual address (the
    NetBSD/Linux `mem` semantics). Only resident pages are returned (see Apple
    Silicon note)
  - `map` / `maps` — the process's virtual-memory regions (`map` in NetBSD
    procfs format, `maps` in Linux `/proc/<pid>/maps` format), with address
    ranges and protections (see Apple Silicon note)
  - `regs` / `fpregs` — the representative thread's general and FP/SIMD register
    state as the native Mach `arm_thread_state64_t` / `arm_neon_state64_t`
    (x86_64: `x86_thread_state64_t` / `x86_float_state64_t`), supplied by the
    `procfsd` daemon; `EPERM` for Apple platform/hardened binaries, `ENOTSUP`
    without a daemon (see below)
  - `auxv` — XNU's auxiliary-vector equivalent: dyld's `apple[]` array
    (`executable_path=`, `stack_guard=`, `dyld_file=`, `malloc_entropy=`,
    `arm64e_abi=`, …), read from the target's user stack via its pmap

`cmdline`, `fd/` and `threads/` required forward-porting work to function under
PAC on Apple Silicon rather than relying on the unavailable private KPIs: `fd/`
walks the process's file-descriptor table directly, `threads/` enumerates threads
via the BSD `proc->p_uthlist` instead of the inaccessible Mach `task->threads`
queue, and `cmdline` reads the target's user-stack arguments through its pmap
(the `KERN_PROCARGS2` `vm_map_copyin` path is `com.apple.kpi.private`).

`tty` takes a different route. Its accessor `proc_gettty` is
`com.apple.kpi.private` and reaches the terminal through the SMR-protected
`p->p_pgrp`, so it cannot be linked or safely forward-ported. Instead it is
resolved at load time from the on-disk kernel collection (libklookup, fed by the
`procfs_ksyms` staging helper run at install) and called directly — its SMR and
session locking run inside the kernel's own code, so the resolved call is safe.

`loadavg`'s load values come from the `procfsd` daemon's `getloadavg()` — the
kernel's true 1/5/15-minute averages — when it is connected. They are not
reachable from the kext itself: `averunnable`, `compute_averunnable`,
`host_statistics` and `processor_set_info` are all stripped from the kernel and
unexported. So without a daemon the node falls back to a CPU-utilisation
approximation: a `thread_call` samples per-CPU tick counts via the exported
`processor_info(PROCESSOR_CPU_LOAD_INFO)` (with a `processor_t` from the
libklookup-resolved `cpu_to_processor()`) every 5 seconds and feeds
`utilisation × ncpu` through the standard load-average EWMA. That approximation
tracks CPU utilisation rather than run-queue depth, so it saturates near the CPU
count and under-reports a genuinely overloaded machine; it reads `0.00` if
libklookup cannot resolve `cpu_to_processor` either.

`meminfo` reports `MemTotal` from the `hw.memsize` sysctl and `MemFree` using
FreeBSD's `linprocfs_domeminfo` estimate (`MemFree = MemTotal − wired`). The
wired-page count comes from the kernel's `vm_page_wire_count` global resolved
via libklookup, because the `vm.*` page-count sysctls are not readable from
kernel context and most `vm_page_*_count` globals are stripped on arm64.
`Cached`, `Buffers` and swap have no kernel-reachable source there and read 0
(`MemFree` reads 0 if libklookup cannot resolve the wired count).

`mem` reads the target's memory through its pmap (`get_task_pmap`,
`pmap_find_phys`, `ml_phys_read`) — the same physical-aperture path `cmdline`
uses — since the BSD faulting path (`vm_map_copyin`) is `com.apple.kpi.private`.
A consequence of not faulting is that only resident pages are returned: reading
an unmapped or paged-out address (including offset 0, the NULL page) returns
`EIO`, and a read stops cleanly at the first hole. Access is gated by the same
credential check as the rest of the filesystem.

`map` and `maps` enumerate the process's VM regions through the libklookup-
resolved `mach_vm_region()` (with `get_task_map()`): macOS exports no region-
enumeration KPI a kext may link, and the internal walkers are stripped on
arm64. `mach_vm_region()` takes the map's read lock itself, so this needs no
struct-walking or manual locking. Both nodes share one walk and differ only in
formatting (`map` NetBSD-style, `maps` Linux-style). Backing-file paths (the
trailing Linux column) are not resolved — the region's object→vnode is not
reachable here — so the device/inode/path columns read `00:00 0`.

`regs` and `fpregs` expose a thread's register state. `thread_get_state()` is
neither a bindable KPI symbol nor present in the arm64 kernelcache symbol table
(so it can be neither linked *nor* resolved via libklookup), so the kext cannot
read register state itself. The `procfsd` daemon does it from userspace instead —
`task_for_pid()` + `task_threads()` + `thread_get_state()` on the process's
representative thread — and returns the native Mach state struct over the
kernel-control bridge. Because `task_for_pid` is denied to root for Apple
platform/hardened binaries under SIP/AMFI, those processes return `EPERM` — the
same permission model as `ptrace` on Linux. On arm64e the saved `pc`/`lr` carry
their PAC bits and are emitted raw, leaving stripping to the consumer.

`auxv` reports XNU's equivalent of the ELF auxiliary vector. macOS binaries are
Mach-O, so there is no `AT_*` array on the stack; the closest analog is dyld's
`apple[]` array — the `key=value` strings the kernel places after `argv`/`envp`.
The node finds them by skipping the `argc` slot and the `argv`/`envp` pointer
arrays on the target's user stack (read through its pmap, as `cmdline` does) and
following each `apple` pointer to its string. Zombies and system processes report
empty.

`partitions` enumerates block devices through IOKit, matching the `IOMedia`
class — every whole disk and partition, mounted or not, exactly as Linux's
`/proc/partitions` does. That data lives in the IORegistry, reachable only via
the C++ IOKit runtime (the C IOKit KPI exposes no registry matching), so this is
the kext's one C++ translation unit (`procfs_iokit.cpp`): it matches `IOMedia`
by name and reads each object's `BSD Name`/`BSD Major`/`BSD Minor`/`Size`
properties off the base `IORegistryEntry`, needing only the base IOKit and
libkern KPIs (no dependency on `IOStorageFamily`'s `IOMedia` class). Each row is
`major minor #blocks name` with the 1 K block count from the media size. If
IOKit matching fails, the node falls back to the mounted-filesystem list
(`vfs_iterate()` + `vfs_statfs()`), which shows mounted volumes only.

### The `procfsd` daemon

Several fields are unreachable from a kext on Apple Silicon: the kernel
functions that produce them (`fill_taskprocinfo`, `task_info`, per-thread info,
the VM-statistics globals) are stripped from the kernel symbol table, and the
data lives in per-CPU/`recount` structures with no linkable accessor. The
`procfsd` userspace daemon supplies these via `libproc`'s `proc_pidinfo()` and
`host_statistics64()` — the same interfaces `top`/Activity Monitor use — over a
privileged `PF_SYSTEM` kernel control (`procfs_ctl.c`): a node read sends a
request and the daemon replies. So `taskinfo` (all 18 fields exact),
`task/<tid>/{info,comm,stat,status,sched}` and `vmstat` are fully populated when
the daemon runs, and fall back to the kext's best-effort values (or zero) when
it does not. The daemon also stages the libklookup symbol file at boot and,
when armed, loads the kext; see *Installing*. `taskinfo`'s `pti_resident_size`
is then the exact `phys_footprint` from the daemon (the kext's own estimate is
only the fallback). Without the daemon the per-thread `info` reads zero
(`fill_taskthreadinfo` is stripped from the arm64 kernel).

The daemon is also the *only* source for the `regs`/`fpregs` register nodes:
`thread_get_state()` is unreachable from the kext (neither bindable nor in the
kernelcache symtab), so those nodes require a connected daemon and return
`ENOTSUP` without one, or `EPERM` for a `task_for_pid`-denied (SIP/AMFI) target.

**Present but not yet functional:**

  - `note` — NetBSD-style node; reads return `EINVAL` as on NetBSD, but the node
    model is currently read-only (no `vnop_write`) and note delivery is
    unimplemented, so writing one is not yet possible.

**Presentation mode (native vs Linux):** the `procfs.linux` sysctl selects how
nodes that have both renderings present themselves — `0` (default) = native
BSD/XNU, `1` = Linux-compatible. It is a live global toggle:

    sudo sysctl -w procfs.linux=1     # Linux-compatible
    sudo sysctl -w procfs.linux=0     # native (default)

Currently `regs`, `fpregs` and `auxv` honour it: in native mode they emit the
binary Mach state / the raw `apple[]` array; in Linux mode they emit the
human-readable text forms (`x0 0x…`, `q0 0x…`, `AT_PAGESZ …`) from
`procfs_linux.c`. Other nodes keep their single format for now.

**Not yet present (planned — see TODO):**

  - Further Linux-style `/proc` files (`/proc/sys/`, …).

## How to build procfs
`make` builds the kext, the `procfs.fs` mount bundle, the userspace tools
(`procfsd`, `procfs_ksyms`) and the LaunchDaemon plist into `bin/`:

    make                    # native arch (arm64e on Apple Silicon)
    make ARCH=universal     # fat arm64e + x86_64

To build and install in one step, use the install script — it runs
`make clean && make && sudo make install` and prompts for your password:

    ./install.sh                # native arch
    ./install.sh ARCH=universal

`sudo make install` **only copies** the prebuilt artifacts into place (it never
compiles, so `bin/` and the build tree stay owned by you and `make clean` never
needs sudo). It installs, with `root:wheel`/`755`: the kext to
`/Library/Extensions`, the `procfs.fs` bundle to `/Library/Filesystems`,
`procfsd`/`procfs_ksyms` to `/usr/local/sbin`, and the LaunchDaemon plist to
`/Library/LaunchDaemons`. It also adds `proc` to `/etc/synthetic.conf` (so `/proc`
is created at boot) and enables the LaunchDaemon. `sudo make uninstall` reverses
all of this — unmounts, unloads the kext, clears the staging cache, and removes
the installed files.

Code signing is optional; the kext is ad-hoc signed by default. To sign with
your own certificate instead, edit `Makefile.inc` and set the `SIGNCERT`
variable to the identity in your keychain.

Auto-load of the kext and auto-mount of `/proc` stay **disarmed** until you
create the arm flag, so a kext panic during development cannot boot-loop the
machine:

    sudo touch /var/db/procfs.enabled
    sudo reboot

After the reboot, `procfsd` stages the kernel symbols, loads the kext, and mounts
`/proc` for all users.

### Loading the kext (Apple Silicon, macOS 26)

Third-party kexts are loaded from the Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AuxKC). After
the first install you must approve the extension in **System Settings → Privacy
& Security** and reboot.

When **re-installing a rebuilt kext**, the build's code identity (cdhash)
changes, and a stale staging record will cause `kernelmanagerd` to reject it
with *"tried to insert an invalid codeful kernel extension in the restricted
lookup table."* `./install.sh` handles this: `make install`'s preinstall step
unmounts procfs, unloads the old kext and clears the staging cache before
copying the new build. To load into the running kernel without a reboot:

    sudo kmutil load -p /Library/Extensions/procfs.kext
    kextstat | grep procfs

## Mounting
With the arm flag set (see *How to build procfs*), `procfsd` mounts `/proc`
automatically at boot. `/proc` itself is created by `/etc/synthetic.conf`.

To mount manually (the kext must be loaded):

    sudo mount -t procfs procfs /proc

## Exploring the file system
Once mounted you can execute the `ls` command to list the contents:

    ls -l /proc

Or recursively:

    ls /proc/*/*/*/*

Note: Finder support has not yet been implemented so the contents of the proc folder will not be visible there. Currently only terminal is supported.

Likewise you can use the `cat` command to get the contents of a file:

    cat /proc/version

Most per-process files contain binary structures rather than text, so pipe them
through `hexdump` to read the raw contents:

    cat /proc/curproc/taskinfo | hexdump -C
    cat /proc/self/regs | hexdump -C
    cat /proc/self/auxv | tr '\0' '\n'

## TODO:
 - Extend the `procfs.linux` presentation-mode switch to more nodes as native
   and Linux renderings diverge (only `regs`/`fpregs`/`auxv` differ today).
 - Implement `note` delivery (and a `vnop_write` path so the node is writable).
 - Fix per-node timestamps reported by `getattr` (currently show placeholder values in `ls -l`).
 - Make the code, function names, structures, etc. be more consistent with NetBSD's procfs for easier comparison and porting.
 - Implement more linux-compatible files a la NetBSD and FreeBSD (`/proc/sys/`, …).

## Issues
Currently known issues:

- On Apple Silicon, `cmdline`, `fd/`, `threads/` and `tty` previously required private kernel symbols unavailable under PAC; they now work (the first three forward-ported, `tty` via libklookup-resolved `proc_gettty`). `tty` depends on the `procfs_ksyms` staging helper having run (it does during `make install`); if the staged symbol file is missing or stale for the running kernel, `tty` falls back to `ENOTSUP`.
- `taskinfo` and per-thread `info` are populated by the `procfsd` daemon (`proc_pidinfo`); they read the kext fallback / zero only when no daemon is connected, since the private `fill_taskprocinfo` / `fill_taskthreadinfo` are stripped from the arm64 kernel.
- `note` is a NetBSD-style scaffold: reads return `EINVAL` and writing a note is not yet possible (no write path / no delivery).
- `regs`/`fpregs` require the `procfsd` daemon (`thread_get_state` is unreachable from the kext — neither a bindable KPI nor in the arm64 kernelcache symtab) and return `EPERM` for Apple platform/hardened binaries, whose task ports `task_for_pid` denies even to root under SIP/AMFI — analogous to `ptrace` permissions on Linux.
- `partitions` now enumerates all block devices (whole disks and partitions, mounted or not) via IOKit's `IOMedia` class (`kext/procfs_iokit.cpp`, the kext's one C++ file). It falls back to the mounted-filesystem list (`vfs_iterate`) only if IOKit matching fails.
- Certain fields in `procfs_docpuinfo`, in kext/procfs_linux.c, such as `bugs` and `pm` have yet to be incorporated. Support for CPU flags for AMD CPUs is also still limited.
